==========

Give it some credentials and a text file, and get a twitter feed. 

The idea that sparked this project for me was to see what people thought of tweeting entire books. Namely public domain books since there is almost no chance of me getting the rights to any kind of legit book. Thus this project was born.

[Project Gutenburg](http://www.gutenberg.org) was a big enabler for me here. 

Their policy is as follows: 
> This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org


Their Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. I highly recommend you check them out.
